					<p>A good education has always been highly valued in China. As far back as the Shang Dynasty, inscriptions on bones or tortoise shells were the simple records of teaching and learning. In the Spring and Autumn Period, private schools prevailed and many scholars of different schools of thought spread their teaching in this way.</p>
<p>In the Han Dynasty the most prevalent method was merely through observation. Officials would see who was intelligent and recommend individuals to their superior. This restricted the source of talented people and did little to provide any kind of equality for the population as a whole. The system of the Imperial Examination, or Keju in Chinese, became the method by which talented people were recognized and selected for future positions in civil service. It began to be put into practice in the Sui Dynasty and lasted more than 1,300 years until the last examination during the Qing Dynasty. Thus it enjoyed a long and dominant position in the history of ancient Chinese education.</p>
<p><img src="/yuque/0/2020/jpeg/551799/1584168688524-dfacfb0e-4c6c-402a-99d2-c93132078700.jpeg#align=left&amp;display=inline&amp;height=610&amp;name=15-15020916033Cb.jpg&amp;originHeight=610&amp;originWidth=1000&amp;size=229445&amp;status=done&amp;style=none&amp;width=1000" alt="15-15020916033Cb.jpg">
The imperial examinations comprised two parts, namely an art exam and the Wushu exam. The arts examination includes composition, the study of books, laws, calligraphy, paintings and so on, while the Wushu examination was used for selecting military officers but was not subject to the same degree of importance as the art examination.</p>
<p>In the Song Dynasty, subjects raised by the government had been much fewer than that in the Tang Dynasty, but the examination for &ldquo;Jinshi&rdquo; was still fashionable. With the coming of the Ming Dynasty, the imperial examination system reached its period of full bloom. Great attention was paid to the administrative procedures and the tests became more rigorous.</p>
<p>The central government managed to found schools called &ldquo;Guozijian&rdquo;, and strengthened their function to be the only road by which people could take the exams. There were in total three stages leading to realizing the dream of becoming an official: provincial examination, a metropolitan examination by the Board of Rites and Palace examination by the emperor himself Only students of &ldquo;Guozijian&rdquo;, commonly known as &ldquo;Xiucai&rdquo;, could participate at the provincial level as their starting point.</p>
<p>The provincial and metropolitan examiners tested only &ldquo;eight-legged&rdquo; essays and people easily realized that the quality of that sort of essay was the key to achieving a pass. Therefore, it became usual for them to concentrate too much energy on it, neglecting other forms and contents.</p>
<p>Eventually, it was realized that this method was harmful as it stifled both creativity and imagination. Since the Qing Dynasty was dominated by the Manchu ethnic group, they gave their people priority over the Han people. Manchu people attending the imperial examination were not tested but required only to undertake some translation, yet the Han people still formed the majority of the examinees. As the tight hold on affairs held by the Qing Dynasty became more and more unpopular, the education system also needed fresh ideas and input as it was a disservice to the country.</p>

<h2 id="the-national-higher-education-entrance-examination">The National Higher Education Entrance Examination</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Gaokao&rdquo; is an academic examination held annually in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. This examination is a prerequisite for entrance into almost all higher education institutions at the undergraduate level It is usually taken by students in their last year of senior high schooL The exams last about nine hours over a period of two days, depending on the province. Chinese, Mathematics and English language in most provinces are required for all students. In addition, students have to choose between two streams, social-science-oriented area, and natural-science-oriented area. Students who choose the former take an additional paper on history, politics, and geography, while those who choose the latter take an additional paper on physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>

<h2 id="a-great-educator-in-china">A Great Educator in China</h2>
<p>Tao Xingzhi was a renowned Chinese educator and reformer in the period of the Republic of China. He studied at Teachers College, Columbia University and returned to China to champion progressive education. His career in China as a liberal educator was not derivative of John Dewey, as some have alleged, but creative and adaptive. He returned to China at a time when the American influence was zesty and self-confident, and his very name at that time &ldquo;Zhixing&rdquo; meant &ldquo;knowledge-action&rdquo;, reflecting the catch-phrase of the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming who once implied that once knowledge in &ldquo;Zhi&rdquo; (知) had been obtained, then action &ldquo;Xing&rdquo; (行) would be easy.</p>
