					<p>The Mongols were nomadic people who herded cattle in the north of the Tang Empire and wandered over a large area fighting on horseback. In China, the Mongols established the very rich Yuan Dynasty. In their camps, the Mongols were entertained by shadow puppet plays in which a lamp cast the shadows of little figurines and puppets on a screen or sheet. Dramatic operatic theaters with human actors speaking in vernacular language was a favorite form of entertainment, and some of China&rsquo;s best dramatic scripts were written then.
<img src="/yuque/0/2020/gif/551799/1584028394315-19594505-66ca-4670-a195-7622c6738921.gif#align=left&amp;display=inline&amp;height=600&amp;originHeight=600&amp;originWidth=800&amp;size=0&amp;status=done&amp;style=none&amp;width=800" alt="">
It is thought that the operatic style of the shadow puppet dramas that entertained the courts influenced the development of the operatic theater style of the Yuan Dynasty. The Yuan rulers were fabulously wealthy according to historical accounts. They had a vast empire and control of trade in Eurasia. For the royal courts or the rich people, refined music, sound effects, and talented singers were employed for shadow plays. The Yuan &ldquo;Zaju&rdquo; style of opera was similar to their shadow plays. Perhaps the playwrights adopted the plots and the features. There were exciting plots, elaborate costumes, refined music and singing, action and dance that the Mongols enjoyed. The music of the &ldquo;Zaju&rdquo; operas was called Yuan Qu, Yuan music. The language used wasn&rsquo;t the classical language but the vernacular language, so that the theater might be enjoyed by everyone. After the Yuan Dynasty, the operatic style developed into the painted-face style of Chinese opera that was popular until modem times.

Guan Hanqing is regarded as one of the best playwrights of the times. He wrote Midsummer Snow which was one of the most popular drama pieces. It is a tragedy about an unjustly accused woman who received justice after her death. The Romance of the Western Chamber was written by Wang Shifu. It is considered one of the best romantic dramas ever written in China.</p>
<p>Novels were another outstanding achievement of the Yuan era. The novelists influenced the future development of the genre. Two novels are still widely read now and are generally considered two of the four greatest novels in Chinese literature. These are Water Margin and The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is written in vernacular language by Luo Guan Zhong. It is a historical fiction about the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms Period. The Three Kingdoms Period is between the Han and Tang eras. Special emphasis is laid on the two famous historical rulers Liu Bei and Cao Cao who were antagonists. It is a long novel of 800,000 words.</p>
<p>Water Margin is about the life and ideals of a group of characters who fight against the corrupt Northern Song Dynasty that the Mongols conquered. It is said it was written in vernacular language by Shi Naian, but scholars debate about the authorship. Many scholars think that the first seventy chapters were written by Shi Naian and the last 30 chapters were written by Luo Guan Zhong who was also the author of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</p>

<h2 id="guan-hanqing">Guan Hanqing</h2>
<p>Guan Hanqing is a dramatist in the Yuan Dynasty who was considered by many critics to be the greatest playwright of the Chinese classical theater. Fourteen of his plays, from more than sixty with known titles, have been preserved. Several of them are unquestionable masterpieces, and there is little doubt that Guan played an important role in raising the early Chinese drama to a new level of excellence. Though Guan&rsquo;s plots, following the fashion of his time, were unrealistic, he created compelling characters, often women of low social standing who acted with intelligence, integrity, and courage. His style is simple and straightforward, probably closer to the spirit of early popular theatre than to the style of plays by his contemporaries.

<h2 id="the-classical-chinese">The Classical Chinese</h2>
<p>Chinese is one of the oldest written languages in the world. Centuries ago the only way people from different regions in China could communicate was through the written language, which we know as classical Chinese also called Wenyan or Guwen. Classical Chinese was, and is, used for scholarly works and literature. Many of the words and phrases used in classical Chinese are not meant to be spoken and would have no meaning if spoken because they do not correspond to speech. This is somewhat like the difference between spoken English and the English used in scholarly journals, or literature. For much of Chinese history, the written language was known only by scholar-officials, who were members of the educated class.</p>
