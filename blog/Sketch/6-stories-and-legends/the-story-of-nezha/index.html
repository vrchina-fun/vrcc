					<p>According to the work Fengshen Bang, Nezha was born during the Shang Dynasty in a military fortress at Chentang Pass. His father was a military commander named Li Jing, who later became the &ldquo;Pagoda-wielding Heavenly King&rdquo;. Nezha&rsquo;s mother, Lady Yin, gave birth to a ball of flesh after being pregnant with him for three years and six months. Li Jing thought that his wife had given birth to a demon and attacked the ball with his sword. The ball split open and Nezha jumped out as a boy instead of an infant. Nezha could speak and walk immediately after birth. He was later accepted by the immortal Taiyi Zhenren as a student He had two elder brothers, Jinzha, a disciple of Wenshu Guangfa Tianzun, and Muzha.</p>
<p>Once East Sea Dragon King AoGuang sent Yecha to capture for him a girl and a boy. Nezha and two other children were playing by the sea when Yecha appeared and captured one of Nezha&rsquo;s friends. Nezha then fought him and injured him severely, causing him to return to the King. The Dragon King sent Ao Bing, his third son, but the latter was slain by Nezha. AoGuang called for his brothers and confronted Nezha and his family. He threatened to flood Chentang Pass and report Nezha to the Jade Emperor. To save his family and the people, Nezha committed suicide himself then carving up his flesh and dismembering his bones &ldquo;returning&rdquo; these to his parents in repayment for the debt of his birth.</p>
<p>Nezha was later brought back to life by his teacher, Taiyi Zhenren, who used lotus roots to construct a human body for his soul and gave him two new weapons: the Wind Fire Wheels and the Fire-tipped Spear. Li Jing was very angry with the trouble maker Nezha and with the reincarnation of Nezha by his master, so the father and son fought many battles. However, Li Jing soon realized that his mortal body was no match for Nezha so he ran for his life. On the run, he met his second son, Muzha, who fought and was defeated by Nezha. Li Jing tried to commit suicide but was saved by Wenshu-Guangfa-Tianzun, who also contained Nezha. In the end, Nezha was forced to submit to his father by another deity, RandengDaoren.

<p>Nezha is often depicted as a youth, instead of an adult. He is often shown flying in the sky riding on the Wind Fire Wheels, having the Universe Ring around his body, sometimes in his left hand, the Red Armillary Sash around his shoulders and a Fire-tipped Spear in his right hand. Sometimes, he is shown in his &ldquo;three heads and six arms&rdquo; form. He has the ability to spit rainbows in some legends.</p>

<h2 id="creation-of-the-gods">Creation of the Gods</h2>
<p>Creation of the Gods, also known as the &ldquo;Investiture of the Gods&rdquo;, is a Chinese novel written by Xu Zhonglin, during the Ming Dynasty, in which we can find the story of Nezha. It is called Fengshen Bang in Chinese. The story is set in the last days of the Shang Dynasty and tells of a popular social movement to overthrow the corrupted and unpopular tyrant emperor Zhou. The leader of this movement was Emperor Wu of the Zhou Dynasty, who actively sought wise advisors and eventually led a group of disenfranchised nobilities and commoners to overthrow the Shang. The novel ends with the overthrow of the Shang and the founding of the Zhou Dynasty.</p>

<h2 id="ferghana-horses">Ferghana horses</h2>
<p>Ferghana horse, also called sweat blood horse in Chinese, is one of China&rsquo;s earliest major imports. It was native to Turkmenistan during the Han Dynasty, and it was brought back to China by Zhang Qian&rsquo;s diplomatic mission. Since then, it became the bonded mount for Chinese ancient emperors. They loved it because it was well-figured and understanding. They even considered it as &ldquo;horse from heaven&rdquo;. Chinese paintings and statuary indicate they had powerful crests, short legs and round-barreled bodies. Though this breed has rarely been seen during the past eight or seven centuries in China, its glory and mystery remain. The steed is depicted in Chinese literature as &ldquo;being able to gallop about 1,000 kilometers a day and another 800 kilometers at night&rdquo;.</p>
