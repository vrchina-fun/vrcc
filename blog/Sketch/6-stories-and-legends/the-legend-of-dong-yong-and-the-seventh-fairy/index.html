					<p>Once there lived a very poor family, with just a father and his son. One year a brutal drought destroyed the land, and sick with sorrow, the father passed away, leaving no inheritance for the son.</p>
<p>The boy, Dong Yong, wanted to give his beloved father a proper funeral, but he had no money at alL The impoverished little scholar effectively sold himself into slavery to pay for his father&rsquo;s funeral Three days after the funeral ended he started working day and night to pay off his debt.</p>
<p>One day, as he took a moment of respite under a tree, a beautiful maiden approached him and asked why he was working so hard with so little rest. Dong Yong told the girl his story and burst into tears.</p>
<p>The maiden had a story of her own as well - she said after her mother died, her new stepmother wanted to marry her off to someone. She then burst into tears as well Dong Yong, unsurprisingly, had a novel solution - he suggested they get married, because neither of them had anywhere to go, and neither of them had any family left. From that moment on, the newly wedded husband and wife started working together for the landlord, but he had his conditions. The couple had to weave ten items of cloth each night, and they agreed.</p>
<p>Dong Yong was getting anxious that he would never finish in time. Dong Yong did not know that his lovely wife was the seventh daughter of The Jade Emperor. When her husband was asleep, she weaved ten pieces of beautiful cloth with her fairy magic. Imagine how surprised Dong Yong was when he awoke to find ten perfect pieces of fabric. It became immediately apparent his wife had some kind of secret. Dong Yong could not hold it in anymore and asked his wife how she had weaved such beautiful cloth. She was unable to keep the secret any longer. She had other news as well- she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Dong Yong learned that his beautiful wife was actually a fairy and that they were going to have a baby. He could not possibly have been any happier in his whole life. But all good things must come to an end. When the fairy&rsquo;s father, the Jade Emperor, found out about his daughter&rsquo;s secret husband, he warned her that if she did not come back that same afternoon, he would smash Dong Yong into a million pieces.</p>
<p>The Seventh Fairy loved Dong Yong very much and did not want a cruel death for him, so she said her farewells and told him that the next year she would come back to the exact same spot and give him his newborn son. Dong Yong cried and tried to stop her, but the seventh fairy was flying back to heaven. Dong Yong tried to run after her and catch her and fell down in tears. The legend of Dong Yong has been spreading for over two thousand years and Chinese people no matter young or old know it and use it to symbolize romantic and ever-lasting love between a man and a woman.

<p>Erlang Shen can be translated as &ldquo;Second Son God&rdquo;. &ldquo;Er&rdquo; means 2, &ldquo;Lang&rdquo; means &ldquo;Boy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Son&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shen&rdquo; means &ldquo;god&rdquo;. His mother, Princess Yaoji was the goddess of the desire realm in Heaven, charged with the duty of limiting Gods&rsquo; mortal desires such as love or affection, greed and ambition. While she was pursuing an evil dragon who had escaped from his chains in the heavenly prison, she fell in love with a mortal scholar, Yang Tianyou, who was willing to use his own heart to save her after hers was damaged by the dragon. They married and had three children: Yang Jiao, Yang Jian and Yang Chan. When the Jade Emperor discovered her marriage, he sent his armies to kill the mortal man. Yang Jian and his sister Yang Chan survived.

<h2 id="legend-of-the-white-snake">Legend of the White Snake</h2>
<p>Legend of the White Snake is one of the most famous tales spreading out among folks in ancient China. The tale goes that a white snake came to the human world as she wanted to repay an obligation, and married a scholar named Xu Xian. However, such marriage was opposed by Fahai, a Buddhist monk in Jinshan Temple. He then suppressed the white snake under Leifeng Pagoda at the bank of the West Lake. Many years later, after gained a Zhuangyuan title, the first place in the imperial examination, Madam White Snake&rsquo;s son offered sacrifice to his mother in front of the Leifeng Pagoda. The Buddha was moved by his action and made the pagoda collapse, which enabled the family to reunite.</p>
