					<p>Confucius has the greatest influence on Chinese characters. Besides being a great educationist, thinker, and unsuccessful politician, he was, first of all, an intellect with a noble morality. He pursued truth, kindness, and perfection throughout his life and his success and failure were largely due to his character, which had an everlasting impact on Chinese intellects.</p>
<p>He was born in 551 BC in the State of Lu which is known today as Qufu in Shandong Province. In Chinese, his name was Kong Qiu. Kong was the family name while Qiu was his given name. This was because his parents had prayed for a son at Niqiu Hill and &ldquo;Qiu&rdquo; was an appropriate token of their thanks and joy at having their prayers answered.</p>
<p><img src="/yuque/0/2020/jpeg/551799/1584021369823-c217433d-3b60-4301-8cbd-375e63509ad2.jpeg#align=left&amp;display=inline&amp;height=568&amp;originHeight=568&amp;originWidth=1026&amp;size=0&amp;status=done&amp;style=none&amp;width=1026" alt="">
Patriotism was the driving force for the young Confucius and he set his sights on an official career as a means to apply his political ideals. He had gained some fame by the time he was 30 but it was not until he was 51 that his official life assumed great importance. This eventful career lasted only for four years as he was forced to resign when he found it impossible to agree with the authorities. Such was the opposition to his ideas that he was obliged to leave his country and travel around the states. During those 14 years, he was in danger on many occasions and even risked his life. At the age of 68, he was welcomed back to Lu but he was set up as a respected gentleman without any authority. He died of illness at the age of 73. A brilliant star fell into silence. His students treated him as father and wore the willow for three years. Zigong, one of the famous disciples, set up a cabin near his tomb and stayed there for six years to mourn his beloved teacher. He could never have dreamed that his teacher&rsquo;s lonely tomb would develop into the large Cemetery of Confucius and that his ideological system would become the norm for Chinese society. Compared with his frustrating political career, his career as a teacher and philosopher was brilliant and full of achievements.</p>
<p>Much of his approach to education was avant-garde as he promoted the ideas &ldquo;to educate all despite their social status&rdquo; and &ldquo;to teach according to the student&rsquo;s characteristics&rdquo;. The first of these broke the long-standing tradition that only the aristocracy had the privilege of education. He also proposed a complete set of principles concerning the study. He said, &ldquo;Studying without thinking leads to confusion; thinking without studying leads to laziness.&rdquo; Today&rsquo;s quality-education was nothing new to him.</p>
<p>The Analects provides a vivid record of his teachings although he did not write it personally. His words were collected and recorded for posterity by his disciples. The accumulated words of wisdom have been handed down to us as The Analects, one of the most important of all the Chinese classics.</p>

<h2 id="mencius">Mencius</h2>
<p>Mencius was an ancient Chinese thinker, educator, and Confucian philosopher during the Warring States Period. His birth name was Meng Ke and he was born in the State of Lu, only thirty kilometers south to Confucius&rsquo; birthplace. He was often honored as the &ldquo;Second Sage&rdquo; of Confucianism. He inherited Confucius&rsquo; ideas and developed them with his philosophy in many ways. He is most famous for his theory of human nature, advocating that all human beings share innate goodness that can either be cultivated through education and self-discipline or squandered through neglect and negative influences. The Mencius is a book of his conversations with kings of that time. In contrast to the short and self-contained sayings of Confucius, the Mencius consists of long dialogues, arguments and proses.

<h2 id="benevolence">Benevolence</h2>
<p>Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and fidelity are the Five Constant Virtues, which are the most important ones in the traditional virtues of China. Benevolence is the first and most important virtue among the Five Constant Virtues. It manifests itself in the inner mind in love and compassion for people and in avoiding harm or envy toward anyone. In terms of behavior, benevolence demands that one be amiable, not wrangle with others nor do evil deeds. To cultivate one&rsquo;s attentiveness to benevolence, one should use another Confucian version of the Golden Rule: What one does not wish for oneself, he ought not to do to anyone else; what one recognizes as desirable for oneself, he ought to be willing to grant to the others.
